description: >
  Femina is a menstrual health and wellness tracking web app that empowers users to track their periods,
  moods, pain levels, and overall health. It also provides educational resources, a journal page with
  intelligent keyword detection, doctor appointment booking UI, and an emergency ambulance form page. 
  Currently a static site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Femina is planned to evolve with a React frontend,
  Tailwind styling, and a Node.js backend with smart features like symptom-based FAQ suggestions and predictive alerts.
